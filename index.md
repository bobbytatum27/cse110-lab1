# Who am I?
## I'm not sure why you're here, but since you are, here's some stuff about me. 
### Outline
1. Location
2. Sports 
3. Programming and Such

#### Location
I live here: ![Earth](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3upZx2gxxLpW7MBbnKYQLH-1200-80.jpg)

#### Sports
##### Basketball
I've played basketball my whole life, and it's by far my favorite sport. If you ask *me* if I'm good, I'd tell you yes.
But if you ask *my brother*, he might not say the same. In reality, I'd say this quote from Dave Barry sums up my game
the best: 
> I haven't been able to slam-dunk the basetball for the past 5 years. Or, for the thirty-eight years before that,
> either."
###### My favorite players
- Lebron James
- James Harden
- Kyrie Irving
- Jared Levy (he's not famous...yet)

##### Baseball
I don't particularly like the game of baseball. But I do like going to a game and getting some peanuts and a ~beer~
water or two. Here's my favorite stadium: ![Yankees
Stadium](https://img.mlbstatic.com/mlb-images/image/private/t_16x9/t_w1024/mlb/u9zmkg3sl71wayrcljng)
If this were a real game, I'd be in the rafters, cause I'm not swimming in cash to spend on a yankees game.

#### Programming and Such
I like C++ and Python. Not particularly javascript. But all the projects I do often end up being javascript. Oh well.

Here's a piece of python code I like: `a='a=%r;print (a%%a)';print (a%a)` Can  you tell why it's special?
